			<h4>No one knows the way until they have walked it</h4>
			<p>Programming, much like any endavour, is a journey of discovery. A new challenge, is simply a new opportunity to learn. Don't be discouraged if you get lost, everyone is lost in the beginning and as long as you don't give up, you will find you bearings soon enough.
            <br>That feeling of being lost, is therefore, a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It is good to feel comfortable, but that can also be a sign of stagnation. If that happens then just know that is the time that you should dig deeper to find more that you have yet to learn.</p>

			<h4>You are never done learning</h4>
			<p>As the industry and technology is constantly evolving and advancing, software development is a constant learning experience. Whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or the latest framework, there will always be more that you should and should want to learn.
            <br>Learning a new technology is a process of continuous growth. In fact, it's a critical that you never stop learning, or you may get left behind.</p>
           
            <h4>The programming community and the internet are your best friend</h4>
			<p>If you get lost, which will happen, don't be afraid to reach out to others in the community. Most people are more than willing to help. Along with that, consulting the internet is something that all developers do. Don't feel ashamed if you have to, it really is just part of the learning process.</p>
